# FOI request 2

Under the FOI Act please provide me with the information below. Please confirm receipt of this request as soon as possible.

How many individual domiciliary care contracts have been handed back to you by providers in the years below. 
Please also detail the number of hours of care that were contained in those contracts per week, and if available the reasons why the contracts were handed back.

A. The current financial year to date

B. 21/22

For clarity by care contracts, we mean an agreement entered into between your local authority and a care provider which relates to a support/care package for an individual.

For example: 

22/23 - 3 contracts, 21 hours of care per week, couldn’t find staff for care packages

21/22 - 2 contracts, 16 hours of care per week, 1 couldn’t find staff, 1 care provider went bust
