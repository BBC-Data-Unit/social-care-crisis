# FOI requests

Under the FOI Act please provide me with the information below. Please confirm receipt of this request as soon as possible.

### Question 1: The number of inpatients who are currently medically fit to leave hospital in your area, but still reside there.

Please provide this as a series of data points for the last calendar year and the year to date, broken down by day. For each day, please break the data into further categories which detail the reason behind the delayed discharge.

I am aware that some of the data showing the total number of delayed transfers of care is published here: https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/discharge-delays-acute-data/ however I am looking for further information relating to the cause of the discharge delay.

For example, the Welsh Government also used to publish a detailed breakdown of reasons behind delayed discharge - https://statswales.gov.wales/Catalogue/Health-and-Social-Care/NHS-Performance/Delayed-Transfers-of-Care

By way of illustration, a response may look like this:

* 01/01/22 - 100 people awaiting discharge, 20 awaiting physiotherapy, 30 awaiting transport home, 50 awaiting care packages
* 02/01/22 - 90 people awaiting discharge, 15 awaiting physiotherapy, 30 awaiting transport home, 45 awaiting care packages

And so on…. Please provide this data in a spreadsheet format such as excel or a .csv file, with columns for the date, total number of patients and reasons for delay.



### Question 2: How many individual domiciliary care contracts have been handed back to you by providers in the years below. 

Please also detail the number of hours of care that were contained in those contracts per week, and if available the reasons why the contracts were handed back.

A. The current financial year to date

B. 21/22

For clarity by care contracts, we mean an agreement entered into between your local authority and a care provider which relates to a support/care package for an individual.

For example: 

* 22/23 - 3 contracts, 21 hours of care per week, couldn’t find staff for care packages
* 21/22 - 2 contracts, 16 hours of care per week, 1 couldn’t find staff, 1 care provider went bust

## Question 3: For the current financial year and for 21/22 please could you provide:

A. The median time (in days) taken to assess a referral made to adult social services for an assessment of needs. Please include new referrals as well as re-assessment of existing clients.

B. The single longest wait (in days) taken to assess an individual after a referral to adult social services. Please include new referrals as well as reassessments. This should include any support package, whether delivered directly by social services or commissioned by them in any other way.

C. The median time (in days) taken between the completion of assessment and the start of a service identified within their care and support. Please include new referrals as well as re-assessment of existing clients.

D. The single longest wait (in days) between the completion of assessment and the start of a service identified within their care and support. This should include any support package, whether delivered directly by social services or commissioned by them in any other way.

For example: 

21/22 Median time to assess = 7 days, Single longest wait = 45 days, median time for package to begin 12 days, single longest wait = 30 days
