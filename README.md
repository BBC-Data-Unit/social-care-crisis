# Social care in crisis

In July and November 2023, The Shared Data Unit (SDU) looked at how delays for care assessments were contributing to patients remaining in hospital despite being classed as well enough to be discharged. 

The first set of stories, in July, focused on [the scale of those dying - at least 1,300 people - waiting for a care package to start during the last financial year](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-66260332).

The second stories, In November, [looked at the large proportion of patients - around 60% - who were having to stay in hospital at the end of each day despite being classed as fit to leave](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-67125440).

## Methodology

The methodology for each set of stories is outlined in an associated briefing pack or website.
